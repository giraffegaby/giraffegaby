    "This project preforms a chi square test. The user can choose if they want to analyze a hardy weinberg equilibrium population or a mendelian population through the choose_chi_square function. Depending on their choice, either the hardy_weinerg_equilibrium or the mendelian function will be called. Each of which will recieve the observed amounts of each phenotype in the population and print out the degrees of freedom and chi square value based on those amounts. In order to solve for a chi square value, an expected amount of each phenotype will be calculated through either the hwe_expected_calculator or the mendelian_expected_calculator function, depending on which type of analysis was chosen in the beginning. These functions will return a list of expected values for each phenotype. This list, along with a list created with the inputted observed values are sent to the chi_square_calc function which calculates for the chi square value. The p_value_eval function determines a p-value based on the chi square value and degrees of freedom, and evaluates if the null hypothesis can be rejected or not. "
